## k.i.s.s
When I first started web development, I was taught the [k.i.s.s. principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). Keep It Simple Stupid."  This seems important these days, because developers in web development complicate the simpilist things.  Ex. Draw a box... Think of how fast you can do this in pure HTML. No css. No javascript. No node...  Quite easy.

## No framework
Frameworks wrap, repackage, recreate and rewrap simple browser functionality in a complicated way.  However the web browsers have come a long way to optimize, improve and standardize browser technology.  When the web frameworks rewrite their own version of low level browser function, the web browser cannot optimize those functions.  So far the response I have heard in the web development community is "So what? Who cares about milliseconds?"
